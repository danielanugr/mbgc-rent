      description: `Take on the role of the great leaders of the past to build your own Ancient City.

Players will take turns spending their gold each round to build tiles that will increase their city's economy. A city that produces more food and generates commerce brings more population. Make your city grow!

There are 5 types of buildings, each of which provides resources that will help your city evolve from a simple settlement to the largest city in the world.

To place new buildings in your city you will also need a lot of roads. Donâ€™t forget about monuments, which are just as important as the buildings. These will bring you victory points, but claiming one will consume the rest of your gold for the round.

Choose your timing and placement wisely! If your gold runs out, your round is over. Once all players have spent their gold, a new round begins and new buildings and roads will become available.

After 10 rounds or as soon as a player reaches the maximum population limit, the leader of the best city in the ancient world will be the winner of World Wonders!`,
